Most Important Data Structures ðŸ”¥

1. Arrays: A collection of elements, each identified by an index or a key.

2. Linked Lists: A linear data structure where elements are connected via pointers.

3. Stacks: A linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.

4. Queues: A linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.

5. Trees: Hierarchical data structures with a root element and child nodes. Types include Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees (BST), AVL Trees, etc.

6. Heaps: A specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. Commonly used for priority queues.

7. Graphs: A collection of nodes (vertices) and edges, used to represent complex relationships between data.

8. Hash Tables: Data structures that store key-value pairs and allow for efficient retrieval and insertion.

9. Trie: A tree-like data structure used for storing a dynamic set of strings.

10. Disjoint-Set (Union-Find) Data Structure: Used to efficiently track a partition of a set into disjoint subsets.
